# Curses-Bird

A Flappy bird clone using ncurses and c++. Project done for ICT exam at Universit√† della Calabria (https://www.mat.unical.it/demacs)

In order to build you have to install CMake.

https://cmake.org/download/

Then you can create a `build` folder and type in a terminal

```cmake .. && make```

then type
```
./cursesbird
```

Enjoy!

Don't forget to open an issue if you get bugs or glitches!

Next project: A "simple" Neural network using TensorFlow for the bird!


Ps.
This project has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and 16.
On Lubuntu 16 and Xubuntu 16 there are some graphical glitches caused by nCurses and how it works with different terminal emulator.

Thanks to http://thecodingtrain.com/ (aka Daniel Shiffman (http://shiffman.net/)) and the Processing foundation for the idea and the amazing work they do.
