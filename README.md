# Curses-Bird

A Flappy bird clone using ncurses and c++. Project done for ICT exam at Universit√† della Calabria (https://www.mat.unical.it/demacs)

In order to build you have to install CMake.

https://cmake.org/download/

Then you can create a `build` folder and type in a terminal

```cmake .. && make```

or just type

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt && make -f Makefile
```
in both cases then type
```
./cursesbird
```

Enjoy!

Don't forget to open an issue if you get bugs or glitches!

Next project: A "simple" Neural network using TensorFlow for the bird!

Thanks to http://thecodingtrain.com/ (aka Daniel Shiffman (http://shiffman.net/)) and the Processing foundation for the idea and the amazing works they do.
